Elephants are the largest existing land animals.

Three living species are currently recognized: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.

They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea.

The order was formerly much more diverse during the Pleistocene, but most species became extinct during the Late Pleistocene epoch.

Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive skin.

The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects.
